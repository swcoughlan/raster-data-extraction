# CoastEO_Raster_Data_Extraction

The raster data used is for Dublin Bay area with Turbidity and Chlorophyl values. This script allows you to extract values for every pixel from the raster data corresponding to every given GPS co-ordinate (Latitude, Longitude). Furthermore, it computes the average values for the neighbouring pixels in a 3x3 window. It also computes the difference between the Mini_Buoy and extracted values for easier understanding.
